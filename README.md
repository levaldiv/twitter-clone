# Twitter Clone

This Twitter clone is a basic clone of the actual [Twitter](https://twitter.com/). </br>
This is also my second clone created using Tailwind and other amazing tools. <br>

Note: Check out the deployed version [here](https://twitter-clone-orcin.vercel.app/)

## Notes:

I had a fun time cloning Twitter and learned more about Tailwind, NextAuth, Firebase, etc. As expected there may/may not be some bugs
as I am still understanding web development. For now, I will leave as is and in the future I will add more fun stuff and make it more
interative. <br>
